## 1939 Census 

This is not an official census. It is my attempt to reconstruct the 35,000,000 people living in RPII in August 1939, just prior to the outbreak of WWII.

### Goals

Using any datasets I can get my hands on I will attempt to extract all person entities eventually creating an SQL database

### Use Cases

* Historical research / verification
* Genealogical research
* Research related to name propogation, spread of telephone communication, etc.
